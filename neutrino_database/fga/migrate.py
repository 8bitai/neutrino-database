"""OpenFGA model migrator — the ``alembic upgrade head`` analogue (NC-113-a).

OpenFGA authorization models are immutable + versioned and are written only at
store creation, so a model change in source never reaches existing stores.
This migrator sweeps the stores IT OWNS — those named ``*_file_permissions``,
the per-workspace document-ACL stores — and writes the canonical model to any
whose deployed model is missing or not the current schema. Run it on deploy,
right after ``alembic upgrade head``.

It deliberately does NOT touch the gateway's ``neutrino-tenant-*`` RBAC
stores, which carry a different model from a different source file. See
``MANAGED_STORE_SUFFIX``.

Properties:
  * **Idempotent** — a store already at head (semantic hash matches) is skipped;
    re-running writes nothing.
  * **Isolated** — a per-store failure is captured in the report, never aborts
    the sweep.
  * **Stateless** — drift is decided by comparing the deployed model's semantic
    hash to the source; no bookkeeping table. (A ``store_id -> model_hash``
    version table is the documented upgrade if model-version bloat matters.)

``migrate_all_stores`` is transport-agnostic — it talks to an ``FgaAdminClient``
protocol so it's unit-testable without a live OpenFGA. The concrete openfga_sdk
client + CLI live in ``_client.py`` / ``__main__.py``.

# ``model.json`` here is the per-workspace **document-ACL** model
# (user/group/workspace/tenant/doc) used by connector-service and
# ES-Ingestion for stores named ``<workspace_id>_file_permissions``.
#
# The gateway maintains a completely different model on a completely
# different set of stores: the tenant **RBAC** model
# (user/role/permission/app/…) on ``neutrino-tenant-<tenant_id>``, sourced
# from ``neutrino-gateway/app/permissions/authorization_model.json``.
#
# ``list_stores()`` returns every store in the cluster, so the original
# unfiltered sweep wrote the doc-ACL model onto every tenant RBAC store it
# found — measured at 355 stores on a local cluster. Live permission checks
# survive that (the gateway pins ``authorization_model_id`` from
# ``tenant_authz_store``, and old model versions stay readable), but every
# tenant store is left misreporting its own schema, the migrator claims
# success falsely, and any future "read the latest model" path breaks. 31
# such stores were found already corrupted locally.
#
# So: only sweep stores whose name marks them as ours.
